# This Hyperfoil benchmark performs a "Perform fight" operation, which runs a sequence of requests in each iteration:
# 1) Perform a GET to /api/fights/randomfighters to retrieve random fighters, storing the result in a variable (done in parallel with 2)
# 2) Perform a GET to /api/fights/randomlocation to retrieve a random location, storing the result in a variable (done in parallel with 1)
# 3) Pause to look at the fighters & location (as a human user might)
# 4) Perform a POST to /api/fights to perform the fight, sending the result from steps 1 and 2 as the request body

# Here is a list of all the parameters and their default values that can be adjusted when running:
#
# SERVICE_PROTOCOL=http (The protocol used by the benchmark)
# SERVICE_HOST=localhost (The host the rest-fights application is running on)
# SERVICE_PORT=8082 (The port the rest-fights application is running on)
# SHARED_CONNECTIONS=400 (The number of connections to share across the requests)
# USERS_PER_SEC=20 (The number of users per second)
# MAX_SESSIONS=200 (The maximum number of hyperfoil sessions to make available)
# DURATION=10s (The duration to run the benchmark)
# PAUSE_TIME_DURATION=1s (The duration to pause, as described in step 2 of the workflow)
